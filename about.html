                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>To support young athletes living in Chicago's 
                    northside neighborhoods, who have an interest
                    in learning and playing soccer, with 
                    opportunities to learn and practice skills 
                    related to the game of soccer, especially 
                    those skills related to team cooperation and 
                    good sportsmanship.</p>

                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to 
                    develop strong, well-rounded, and mindful 
                    athletes through the building of character, 
                    self-discipline, and leadership.</p>

                <h3>General Info</h3>
                <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was 
                    established in 1996 to provide athletes residing
                    in Chicago's northside neighborhood an 
                    environment to learn and play soccer. To be a 
                    member of NYSL, you must be between the ages of
                    4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside 
                    neighborhood. NYSL is run by a small, full-time 
                    staff, and relies on the generous volunteer 
                    time of parents and former league members.</p>
