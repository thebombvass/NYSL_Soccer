                northside neighborhoods, who have an interest
                in learning and playing soccer, with

                related to the game of soccer, especially

            <h3>Vision</h3>

            <h3>General Info</h3>
            <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was 
                established in 1996 to provide athletes residing
                in Chicago's northside neighborhood an 
                environment to learn and play soccer. To be a 
                member of NYSL, you must be between the ages of
                4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside 
                neighborhood. NYSL is run by a small, full-time 
                staff, and relies on the generous volunteer 
                time of parents and former league members.</p>
